# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking

- Check layers, cycles and entries over the production graph only. Test code sits in no layer: a test file or `test_support` file listed in `ci/layers.zig` fails as "test source in a layer". Remove test files and test-only layers from the table.
- Ownership reads the layer patterns: every production source matches exactly one layer. `required` only names paths that must exist; it no longer has to list every source.
- New structure rules: "production reaches tests" fails a production edge into test code, and "test layers" fails an inline-test import of a higher layer than its file.
- Fail an import in a declaration nothing reaches (no public, exported or comptime member, field, `main` or test leads to it), in test code too.
- Path patterns use gantry's dialect everywhere, including `test_support` and `function_limits`: `*` no longer crosses `/`. Write `src/testing/**` for nested support; that is now the default.
- The structure runner reads `test_support` from the configured `ci/preflight.json`.
- The source checks no longer refuse a production declaration that imports a test file by name; "production reaches tests" replaces it and lets a declaration only tests reach import test code.
- Pin gantry 441acce, where Zig imports in test context are test edges and `check` returns owned `Findings`.
- Shard by test case, not by named case. `ci/workflow.json` takes `"shards": {"windows": n, "macos": n, "linux": n}` and `"fast_shards": n`; `windows_shards`, `fast_windows_shards`, `shard_jobs`, `fast_linux_shards`, `fast_linux_jobs` and `priority` fail the plan. Each shard job compiles the whole suite once and the test runner runs its share, balanced by `ci/durations.json`. Matrix jobs carry `shard` instead of `cases`, and the runner no longer passes `-Dtest-case`; drop the case options from the package's build.
- The reusable workflow drops the `measured-plan` input and its planning job; the static matrices are complete. The `preflight-full-<sha>` proof artifact holds the refreshed `durations.json` instead of `summary.json`.
- `preflight_order.init` takes the test functions rather than their count, and returns only this shard's indices. The module file is `src/order.zig`.
- The shared runner's `fuzz` is upstream's; it reports a fuzz test only in a build with fuzzing, as upstream's runner does.
- Timing records carry a `key` (`windows-Debug`), and shard timing files end `-2of5.ndjson` rather than with a case name.

### Added

- `Config.test_timeout`: a watchdog in the shared runner fails a test that outlasts it, Io teardown included, with its name, phase and seed.
- `addConsumerCheck` generates and builds the consumer project, replacing each package's `ci/consumer/` build and manifest; `addCheck` builds, tests and runs a repository check program.
- `zig build ci-linux` falls back to preflight's Debian image with the pinned Zig when a package has no `ci/linux.Dockerfile`.
- `zig build profile` folds timing records into `ci/durations.json`, keeping targets a run did not measure.
- preflight gates itself with its own `ci/layers.zig` and lint; `zig build verify` runs them.
- Keep exact exception ledgers shrinking, reject stale debt, check unreachable reasons, debug prints and file case, shuffle tests by seed, and report assertion density.

- Share source checks and fast and full CI gates through Zig alone, with a build helper and a reusable workflow.

- Run fast CI in one stage per host and plan only measured full-tier shards.

### Fixed

- The full tier's ThreadSanitizer job leaves the source checks to their own job, as every other test job does.
- `catch unreachable` and `std.debug.print` checks skip the configured `test_support`, not always `src/testing/`.
